# Stellar Classification
## Final Project for my BSc Computer Science at the University of London
### Deep learning on a public dataset

In this project, I use the universal workflow of machine learning from _Fran√ßois Chollet's_ *Deep Learning with Python* to develop a deep neural network for the purpose of stellar classification.

This network utilises the *Apparent magnitude*, *Stellar parallax* and *B-V colour index* to predict both the stellar and luminosity class of observations.
